# Lift Calculation Simulation

This project simulates the calculation of lift force on an airfoil based on uncertain parameters such as temperature, pressure, and relative humidity. Monte Carlo simulation is used to propagate uncertainties through the model.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mailjavvad/lift-calculation-simulation.git
   cd lift-calculation-simulation
